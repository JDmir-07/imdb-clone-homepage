// Create the navbar 

Inside the main I want to reuse the aside bar just like I did with the music player. And add breakpoints where the aside bar outside the main will have display set to none and the aside bar inside the main  will be set to block.

// Main should have 
// Flex-wrap : warp
// And all the justify-content and align-items as centers it will do that itself

// Design by using the concept of cards ,, can think later about this


// index2.html ==> movie page 
// should have a breakpoint on 900px;

breakpoint for favourite list 840px;
